***
The project aims at gathering the Weather and Traffic data for selective 5 cities in realtime and reporting in realtime how these parameters are changing every hour. It then shows the correlation between the traffic speed & congestion with weather KPIs like temperature, AQI etc. Also, it has the feature to predict and forecast weather and traffic KPIs for next 6 hours.
